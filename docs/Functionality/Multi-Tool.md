## Browser Storage and Privacy

### How It Works
- Files stored in your browser's **local IndexedDB**
- Data never leaves your device until you process
- Only you can access your stored files
- Storage is per-domain (isolated from other sites)

### Storage Limits
Typical browser limits:
- **Chrome/Edge:** ~10GB or 60% of available disk space
- **Firefox:** ~10GB
- **Safari:** ~1GB (more restrictive)

### Privacy Controls
- **Clear on Exit:** Configure browser to clear data on close
- **Manual Clear:** Use "Clear Files" button anytime
- **Incognito Mode:** Storage cleared when window closes
- **Desktop App:** Full offline privacy, unlimited storage

### Security Notes
- Files are **not encrypted** in browser storage
- Don't store highly sensitive documents long-term
- Use desktop app for sensitive work
- Clear storage on shared/public computers

---

## Troubleshooting

### Files Disappeared
**Possible Causes:**
- Browser cleared storage automatically
- You clicked "Clear Files"
- Browser data was cleared manually
- Switched to incognito mode

**Solutions:**
- Check Downloads folder (you may have saved them)
- Use desktop app for persistent storage
- Enable "persistent storage" in browser settings

---

### Out of Storage Space
**Symptoms:** Can't upload new files, error messages

**Solutions:**
1. Clear old/completed projects
2. Download and delete large files

### Multi-Tool Running Slowly
**Symptoms:** Lag, freezing, slow response

**Solutions:**
