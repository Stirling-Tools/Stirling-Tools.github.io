# How to add Configurations

Stirling PDF allows easy customization of the app.
Includes things like

- Custom application name
- Custom slogans, icons, HTML, images CSS etc (via file overrides)

There are two options for this, either using the generated settings file ``settings.yml``
This file is located in the ``/configs`` directory and follows standard YAML formatting

Environment variables are also supported and would override the settings file
For example in the settings.yml you have

```
security:
  enableLogin: 'true'
```

To have this via an environment variable you would have ``SECURITY_ENABLELOGIN``

The Current list of settings is

```yaml
security:
  enableLogin: false # set to 'true' to enable login
  csrfDisabled: false # set to 'true' to disable CSRF protection (not recommended for production)
  loginAttemptCount: 5 # lock user account after 5 tries; when using e.g. Fail2Ban you can deactivate the function with -1
  loginResetTimeMinutes: 120 # lock account for 2 hours after x attempts
  loginMethod: all # Accepts values like 'all' and 'normal'(only Login with Username/Password), 'oauth2'(only Login with OAuth2) or 'saml2'(only Login with SAML2)
  initialLogin:
    username: '' # initial username for the first login

There is an additional config file ``/configs/custom_settings.yml`` where users familiar with java and spring application.properties can input their own settings on-top of Stirling-PDFs existing ones. For more info on any custom settings such as SSL or DEBUG mode please check [here](Extra-Settings)


#### Extra notes
- Endpoints. Currently, the endpoints ENDPOINTS_TOREMOVE and ENDPOINTS_GROUPSTOREMOVE can include comma separate lists of endpoints and groups to disable as example ENDPOINTS_TOREMOVE=img-to-pdf,remove-pages would disable both image-to-pdf and remove pages, ENDPOINTS_GROUPSTOREMOVE=LibreOffice Would disable all things that use LibreOffice. You can see a list of all endpoints and groups [here](https://github.com/Stirling-Tools/Stirling-PDF/blob/main/Endpoint-groups.md)
- customStaticFilePath. Customise static files such as the app logo by placing files in the /customFiles/static/ directory. An example of customising app logo is placing a /customFiles/static/favicon.svg to override current SVG. This can be used to change any images/icons/css/fonts/js etc in Stirling-PDF

### Environment only parameters

- ``SYSTEM_ROOTURIPATH`` ie set to ``/pdf-app`` to Set the application's root URI to ``localhost:8080/pdf-app``
- ``SYSTEM_CONNECTIONTIMEOUTMINUTES`` to set custom connection timeout values
- ``DOCKER_ENABLE_SECURITY`` to tell docker to download security jar (required as true for auth login)
- ``LANGS`` to define custom font libraries to install for use for document conversions

### Local
If running Java directly outside of docker, you can set these environment variables before starting the app:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="unix" label="Unix">
    ```bash
    export UI_APPNAME="Stirling PDF"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cmd" label="Windows (CMD)">
    ```batch
    set UI_APPNAME=Stirling PDF
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="powershell" label="Windows (PowerShell)">
    ```powershell
    $env:UI_APPNAME = "Stirling PDF"
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Docker Configuration

If using Docker, you can set environment variables via either Docker run or Docker Compose as part of your installation.
Simply add these to the end of your script/file:

<Tabs groupId="docker-config">
  <TabItem value="docker-run" label="Docker Run">
    ```bash
    -e "UI_APPNAME=Stirling PDF" \
    -e "UI_HOMEDESCRIPTION=Your locally hosted one-stop-shop for all your PDF needs." \
    -e "UI_APPNAVBARNAME=Stirling PDF" \
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker-compose" label="Docker Compose">
    ```yaml
    environment:
      UI_APPNAME: Stirling PDF
      UI_HOMEDESCRIPTION: Your locally hosted one-stop-shop for all your PDF needs.
      UI_APPNAVBARNAME: Stirling PDF
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
