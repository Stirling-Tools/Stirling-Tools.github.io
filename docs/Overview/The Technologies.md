# The Technologies Behind Stirling PDF

Stirling PDF harnesses several technologies throughout.

# Java
As part of the JAVA framework to host the WebUI itself we use
Spring Boot, Thymeleaf and PDFBox.
Apache PDFBox is the core of the PDF functionality within Stirling-PDF.
They offer a variety of methods to edit PDFs which we have then build Stirling-PDF on.
We also show all licenses used within our Java application [here](https://stirlingpdf.io/licenses)

# JavaScript
- [PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js)
- [PDF-LIB.js](https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib)


# Others
We also use other open source applications along side ours to offer additional functionality.
- [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/libreoffice/) for advanced conversions
- [OCRmyPDF](https://github.com/ocrmypdf/OCRmyPDF) is used for OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to change PDF images into text.
- GhostScript, Bundled with OCRmyPDF, this is used to compress PDF documents.
